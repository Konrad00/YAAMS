# YAAMS - Yet Another Airline Management System

YAAMS is a new alternative to PHPvms or Virtual Airline Manager. With YAAMS we wanted to take a more modern approach to virtual airlines software by using new techniques and going by the standard of "API first".

## Status
Right now we are thinking about the correct architecture and Framework to use for the application.

## Upcoming features
* API first, so you can build your own client easily
* A client written by us in form of a web interface
* Fleet management
* Pilot management
* Authentification system
* Route planning
* A multi platform ACARS (for Linux, Windows & Mac OS)

## Open Source
This software is open source with a reason: Because we want you to commit to the project!

## YAAMS Discord
