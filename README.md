# YAAMS - Yet Another Airline Management System

YAAMS is a new alternative to PHPvms or Virtual Airline Manager. With YAAMS we wanted to take a more modern approach to virtual airlines software by using new techniques and going by the standard of "API first".

## Current status
We've decided to start the coding now with Laravel. It seems to be the excellent system for this kind of project.

Since Laravel also includes builtin support for building REST APIs it suits perfectly.

Right now we are building a "base" for to work with. We are building the software for self hosting use right now, but we've thought about SaaS hosting for a small price. Right now the main priority is self hosting.

## Building

* Install a Laravel development environment (with a DB, composer and PHP)
* `git clone https://github.com/flymia/YAAMS.git' in your directory
* Run a `composer update` to install the components
* Done. Help by adding new features as you like and do a PR

## Upcoming features
* API first, so you can build your own client easily
* A client written by us in form of a web interface
* Fleet management
* Pilot management
* Authentification system
* Route planning
* A multi platform ACARS (for Linux, Windows & Mac OS)
* SaaS hosted

## Open Source
This software is open source with a reason: Because we want you to commit to the project!
