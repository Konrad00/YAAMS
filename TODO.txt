TODO:

* Flight DB entry needs to log the pilot who filed it, too!
* user roles (admin, Airline Manager, etc.)
* Store small images of the airplanes in aircraft table
* Internationalization
* Error handling

Ideas:
* Simbrief integration
* User ranks (Base pilot, advanced pilot, etc.)
* Laravel Backpack for Admin Panel?
